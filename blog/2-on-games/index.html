<h1>Three Qualities of a Good Game</h1>

<p>
January 4, 2026
</p>

<p>
I have played many board and card games over the years. Some were fun once. Some were tolerable with the right people. And a few stayed interesting no matter how many times we played them. Over time, I figured out which values are must-haves for a game to be playable.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to say that good games are about balance, theme, or complexity. I do not think that is true. Many balanced games are boring. Many complex games feel empty. What matters more is how the game treats your attention.
</p>

<p>
For me, a good game should have the following three qualities:
</p>

<h2>1. You should be able to play at all times.</h2>

<p>
In many games, most of the time is spent waiting. Someone takes a long turn, resolves some outcome, and passes control. If there are many players, you can sit for minutes without anything changing for you. You gain no information. You make no decisions. You are frozen.
</p>

<p>
Monopoly is a good example of a terrible game. When others take their turns, nothing meaningful happens from your perspective. You cannot plan. You cannot react. The game pauses.
</p>

<p>
In better games, your turn never fully ends. In poker, you watch how others bet, hesitate, or bluff. In chess, you calculate shared lines deeper. Even when you are not acting, you are playing. You are thinking.
</p>

<p>
If a game forces players to mentally disengage for long stretches, it fails at a basic level.
</p>

<p>
Games that have this quality: poker, chess, Codenames, and Blackjack (if you count cards).
<br>
Games that lack this quality: Monopoly, Mafia (players cannot contribute), and many roll-and-wait party games.
</p>

<h2>2. Outcomes should mostly depend on skill.</h2>

<p>
Some randomness is fine. It adds tension and surprise. It gives weaker players a chance to win occasionally, which keeps games social and enjoyable. But randomness should not dominate.
</p>

<p>
If luck determines most outcomes, effort stops feeling meaningful. There is no reason to think deeply if thinking does not pay off.
</p>

<p>
Games like Exploding Kittens are too random. Decisions rarely matter more than the order of the deck. Winning feels detached from how well you played. Even in games like Uno, where strategy is somewhat trivial, outcomes are still largely driven by the cards you are dealt. Over time, improvement does not feel rewarding.
</p>

<p>
In good games, one match can be noisy, but many matches are not. Better players win more often. Skill shows up with repetition. Without that signal, the game gives you no reason to improve.
</p>

<p>
Games that have this quality: poker, chess, Go, and Secret Hitler.
<br>
Games that lack this quality: Monopoly, Candy Land, pure dice games, rock-paper-scissors.
</p>

<h2>3. It should keep surprising you</h2>

<p>
A game should not feel the same every time you play it. It should resist being exhausted.
</p>

<p>
This can happen in two ways. One is randomness. Shuffled cards and hidden information make each round different. The other is a very large deterministic space. Chess has no randomness, yet it does not feel repetitive because the number of possible positions is enormous.
</p>

<p>
When this quality is missing, games collapse quickly. Tic-tac-toe and Connect Four are only interesting until you understand them. After that, the game turns into a procedure. You are no longer exploring. You are executing.
</p>

<p>
Once a game fully fits in your head, it stops being a game.
</p>

<p>
Games that have this quality: poker, Go, chess, and Terraforming Mars.
<br>
Games that lack this quality: tic-tac-toe, Connect Four, Chopsticks.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Optional: A game should be relatively short.</h2>

<p>
Usually under an hour. Long games demand too much commitment upfront and make it harder to play casually or repeatedly. Shorter games let you iterate, learn faster, and fit more rounds into a session.
</p>

<p>
Games that have this quality: poker (one round takes under 5 minutes), Codenames, Blackjack.
<br>
Games that lack this quality: Terraforming Mars, Factorio, Civilization, Risk.

<h1>On Curiosity</h1>

<p>
December 22, 2025
</p>

<p>
On the way back from Sequoia National Park — which I really recommend, not so much for the
largest trees in the world, but for the views along the way — I had an interesting
conversation with friends in the car.
</p>

<p>
We began, like many late-night drivers do, talking about quantum physics. I was explaining
the basics I still remember from my physics classes, along with some of its stranger ideas:
parallel universes, the observer paradox, the general weirdness of it all. But soon the
conversation drifted into something more philosophical: whether the universe is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-variable_theory">truly random</a>, or whether it only appears random — some kind of pre-baked uncertainty built into
deeper laws.
</p>

<p>
From there, it was a short step to free will. And from free will, it took only one more step
to hit the question underneath everything:
</p>

<p>
 <i>What is our purpose in this world?</i>
</p>

<p>
I have been thinking about this question for a long time. And for me, the answer has always
felt relatively clear: the only real mission humanity could have, in this strange and
mysterious universe, is to understand it. To seek what lies beneath appearances. To
push toward some deeper truth about the world we are in.
</p>

<p>
Other goals have always felt both superficial and short-lived. Some people seek being successful, whatever that
means. Others want to help those around them, to love their neighbor. These goals are valid,
of course. However, they also feel personal, emotionally local, and ultimately short-lived. They
die with the person. The mission dissolves.
</p>

<p>
The only thing that really lasts — the only thing that gets transferred — is knowledge.
</p>

<p>
We do not remember Albert Einstein for how kind he was or how helpful he was to the people
around him. We remember him for a theory that fundamentally changed how we understand space
and time. That mark persists. That is the kind of mark I think humanity can, maybe should,
leave behind.
</p>

<p>
What matters is: what new things did we figure out? What did we actually understand about the
structure of reality before we vanished?
</p>

<p>
That is why the exact length of our timeline, or specific details do not really matter — whether we last ten
thousand years or a hundred thousand. And that is why the twentieth century arguably carries
orders of magnitude more meaning and significance than thousands of years before it: not
because more people lived, but because we understood more.
</p>

<p>
That is why I have always believed that our purpose is to push the boundaries of what is
known.
</p>

<p>
D disagreed.
</p>

<p>
She had a very simple, but unexpectedly powerful response. She said: we can never know
everything. There will always be another question. There will always be a layer we cannot
reach. We brought up <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/">
Gödel's incompleteness theorem</a> as a kind of formal proof of this intuition: there will
always be truths that cannot be proven, knowledge that cannot be verified or fully closed.
</p>

<p>
Her counter-question was sharp.
</p>

<p>
Why is it meaningful to chase something you can never reach?<br>
Why assign meaning to a path with no finish line?
</p>

<p>
To her, the pursuit of knowledge felt artificial. Meaningless in the end. A forever-run with
no arrival. Helping others, improving lives, making the world a little better — that felt
like a clearer purpose, one that actually delivers something concrete.
</p>

<p>
Once you know something, you cannot un-know it. You do not get closure. You just get a
larger unknown. The more you understand, the more impossible the full picture becomes.
</p>

<p>
I realized something uncomfortable then. I had dismissed other people's goals because they
did not last forever. But mine did not end at all. It just keeps going, with no finish line.
</p>

<p>
So what makes mine more valid?
</p>

<p>
For me, the answer is not logical. It is intuitive. It feels like something we are supposed
to do. This intuition is not new. Aristotle opened his <em>Metaphysics</em> with the claim that <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphysical-explanation/">
all humans, by nature, desire
to know</a> — not because knowledge is useful, but because it is something we are drawn to for
its own sake. Maybe there is no end. Maybe there is no final reward. But refusing to ask, refusing
to dig deeper, feels like refusing to be what we are. It feels like a kind of moral failure.
Like giving up.
</p>

<p>
Is the purpose of all this simply to live well — to feel good, to make others feel better, to
optimize for comfort? Or is it something harder? A restless search for meaning that creates
as much discomfort as it resolves?
</p>

<p>
Because, ironically, that endless and possibly hopeless search for answers is what gave us
many of the things that did make life better: electricity, nuclear science, medicine, space
exploration. Much of what shapes our world today came from someone asking “why?” — even when
they did not like the answer, or could not foresee its consequences.
</p>

<p>
That makes curiosity feel like something more than a personal trait. It feels structural.
Almost sacred. Something hardwired into what a human is.
</p>

<p>
It is what separates the names we remember from the crowd of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=NPC" >NPCs</a> lives. It is what
built almost everything around us. And it is also what destroyed a great deal of comfort
along the way.
</p>

<p>
There is a roughly three-thousand-year-old narrative about this tradeoff. A story about a boundary that was not meant to be crossed—about safety and comfort on one side, and knowledge on the other. About how fear and curiosity about the unknown irreversibly changed life forever. Do you recognize this story?
</p>

<p>
I would love to hear what you think: is a question without a final answer still worth asking?
</p>

<p>

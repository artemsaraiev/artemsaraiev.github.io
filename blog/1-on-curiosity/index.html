<h1>No Finish Line</h1>

<p>
December 22, 2025
</p>

<p>
On the way back from Sequoia National Park — which I highly recommend, not so much for the
largest trees in the world, but for the views along the way — I had an interesting
conversation with friends in the car.
</p>

<p>
We began, as many late-night drivers do, talking about quantum physics. I was explaining
the basics I remember from my physics classes, along with some of its stranger ideas:
parallel universes, the observer paradox, the general weirdness of it all. Yet soon the
conversation drifted into something more philosophical: whether the universe is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-variable_theory">truly random</a>, or whether it only appears random — some kind of pre-baked uncertainty built into
deeper laws.
</p>

<p>
From there, it was a short step to free will. And from free will, it took only one more step
to arrive at the question underneath everything:
</p>

<p>
 <i>What is our purpose in this world?</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>I do not think this question has an answer. Purpose feels less like something we can verify and more like something a mind settles into, shaped by what it rewards. Maybe we do not discover purpose so much as rationalize it. Still, some purposes feel more terminal than others.</b>
</p>


<p>
<b>For me, the least arbitrary candidate for a shared purpose is to understand our mysterious universe as well as we can.</b> To seek what lies beneath appearances. To
push toward some deeper truth about the world we are in.
</p>

<p>
Other goals have always felt <b>secondary</b>. <b>That does not mean they are fake, or inferior in any absolute sense. It means that, to me, they often read as instrumental: they keep life stable enough for curiosity to continue operating.</b> Some people seek being successful, whatever that
means. Others want to help those around them, to love their neighbor. These goals are valid,
of course. However, they also feel personal, emotionally local, and ultimately short-lived. They
die with the person. The mission dissolves.
</p>

<p>
The only thing that really lasts — the only thing that gets transferred — is knowledge.
</p>

<p>
We do not remember Albert Einstein for how kind he was or how helpful he was to the people
around him. We remember him for a theory that fundamentally changed how we understand space
and time. That mark persists. That is the kind of mark I think humanity can, maybe should,
leave behind. What matters is what we actually understood about the world before we vanished.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Of course, we remember people for other things too: moral leaders, founders, saints. So remembrance is not a proof. It is only a hint about what scales: knowledge travels farther than a personality can.</b>
</p>

<p>
That is why the exact length of our timeline, or specific details do not really matter — the route matters less than the destination. And that is why the twentieth century arguably carries
orders of magnitude more meaning and significance than thousands of years before it: not
because more people lived, but because we understood more.
</p>

<p>
It is what separates the names we remember from the anonymous gray mass of lives history never records. It is what built much of what surrounds us — and also what ruined a lot of comfort along the way.
</p>

<p>
That is the reason why I have always believed that our purpose is to push the boundaries of what is
known. Even so, my friend D disagreed.
</p>

<p>
Her objection was simple yet powerful: we can never know everything. There will always be another question, a layer we cannot
reach. We brought up <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/">
Gödel's incompleteness theorem</a> as formal proof of this intuition: there will
always be truths that cannot be proven, knowledge that cannot be verified or fully closed.
</p>

<p>
Her counter-question was sharp: Why is it meaningful to chase something you can never reach? <b>Why make it the sole purpose if there is no finish line?</b>
</p>

<p>
To her, the pursuit of knowledge felt artificial. Meaningless in the end. A forever-run with
no arrival. After all, once you know something, you cannot un-know it. You do not get closure — you just get a larger unknown. The more you understand, the more impossible the full picture becomes. Helping others, improving lives, making the world a little better — that felt
like a clearer purpose, one that actually delivers something concrete.
</p>

<p>
I realized something unsettling then. I had dismissed other people's goals because they
did not last forever. Mine, however, did not end at all. It just keeps going, with no finish line.
</p>

<p>
So what makes mine any more valid?
</p>

<p>
For me, the answer is not logical. It is intuitive. It feels like something we are supposed to do. This intuition is not new. Aristotle opened his <em>Metaphysics</em> with the claim that <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphysical-explanation/">
all humans, by nature, desire
to know</a> — not because knowledge is useful, but because it is something we are drawn to for
its own sake. There may be no end. Perhaps there is no final reward. Still, refusing to ask, refusing to dig deeper, amounts to refusing to be what we are. It feels as though you are abandoning your moral duties.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, that is where I had been unfair. Living well — building comfort, stability, even joy — is not the enemy of understanding. It can be what makes understanding sustainable. You need a ground floor before you can build upward. The question is not whether we should live well, but whether living well is the goal, or the foundation.
</p>

<p>
<b>My bias is to treat it as foundation. Comfort, community, even faith can be ends for someone else; I only mean that, in my own hierarchy, they tend to support the one activity that never resolves: trying to understand what is going on.</b>
</p>

<p>
Ironically, that endless and possibly hopeless search for answers is what gave us
many of the things that did make life better: electricity, nuclear science, medicine, space
exploration. Much of what shapes our world today came from someone asking "why?" — even when
they did not like the answer, or could not foresee its consequences.
</p>

<p>
And that pattern is hard to ignore. Again and again, the people who chase understanding for its own sake end up reshaping how everyone lives. At that point, curiosity begins to seem something more than a personal trait. It appears less a matter of choice and more a constant — structural, almost sacred. Something hardwired into what a human is — and worth pursuing, even without the promise of closure. 
</p>

<p>
There is a roughly three-thousand-year-old narrative about this tradeoff. A story about a boundary that was not meant to be crossed—about safety and comfort on one side, and knowledge on the other. About how fear of the unknown and curiosity about it irreversibly changed life forever. Do you recognize this story?
</p>

<p>
I would love to hear what you think: is a question without an answer still worth asking?
